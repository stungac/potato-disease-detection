# 🥔 Potato Disease Detection

This project aims to detect diseases in potato leaves using deep learning-based image classification models. Early detection of plant diseases is critical for reducing crop loss and improving agricultural efficiency.

## 📚 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Potato Disease Leaf Dataset (PLD)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rizwan123456789/potato-disease-leaf-datasetpld), available on Kaggle.

It includes images of potato leaves categorized into 3 classes:

- **Early Blight**
- **Late Blight**
- **Healthy**

The dataset contains high-resolution, labeled RGB images, which were used for training and testing the models.

## 🧠 Deep Learning Models

The following deep learning architectures were trained and evaluated:

- **VGG16**
- **LeNet**
- **ResNet**
- **GoogleNet**
- **MobileNet**

Pre-trained models (VGG16, ResNet, GoogleNet, and MobileNet) were used with transfer learning, where the top layers were replaced and fine-tuned on the potato disease dataset.

## 📊 Results

The following table shows the accuracy values for each model on each class.

| Class          | VGG16 | LeNet | ResNet | GoogleNet | MobileNet |
|----------------|-------|-------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Early Blight   | 0.86  |  0.85 |  0.98  |    0.97   |   0.93    |
| Late Blight    | 0.86  |  0.78 |  0.97  |    0.94   |   0.91    |
| Healthy        | 0.85  |  0.84 |  0.97  |    0.95   |   0.90    |

> 🧪 **Note:** The values represent test set f1-score after model training and evaluation.

|                      | VGG16 | LeNet | ResNet | GoogleNet | MobileNet |
|----------------------|-------|-------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Overall Accuracy** | 0.86  |  0.83 |  0.97  |   0.96    |   0.91    |
